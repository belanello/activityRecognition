## Qualitative Activity Recognition of Weight Lifting Exercises  
The Qualitative Activity Recognition is to recognize how well the certain activities are performed. In this project, we use the data Weight Lifting 
Exercises Dataset, which was collected by wearable sensors while participants are performing the weight lifting exercises in correct ways and also 
with a set of common mistakes. The goal of this project is to build the model to classify the exercise categories.
